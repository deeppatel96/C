This document will provide insight on how we tested procs vs. threads,
the values we logged, and how many times we ran the tests. 

========================================================================
Testing procs vs threads 


Tests for:
1. File does not exist

2. File already compressed

3. More number of segments than Length

4. Adds "./" infront of file name if not already present

5. Segments are equal to length

6. Simple short input

7. Non-alphabetic characters test

8. Numerical characters test

9. Even splits between segments

10. Odd splits between segments

11. Long inputs
		


AVERAGE TIMES
--------------
Threads:
small input, 4 segments: 0.860 ms
large input, 10 segments: 5.392 ms

Processes:
small input, 4 segments: 44.2 ms
small input, 10 segments: 323.2 ms



HOW:
-----
I timed my code by making an outside function and main that ran the thread and process functions and got the times before and after running. I ran the test cases above and the code handled them by warning and exiting and/or warning and continuing by skiping over that segment.
The timing cases I ran 100 times each and logged them and displayed the average of them above. They varied by size of input so I chose to display a smaller test case and a larger test case to showcase the differences.
